h2. Usage

CyDoc is available as Software as a Service. This means that all the maintenance task to run CyDoc are outsourced. You only need web access using a modern web-browser. All traffic is encrypted and your valuable data is backed up routinely.

We try stick with the slogan 'Keep it simple, stupid'. The interface follows modern industrial design rules. All pages try to give you just enough information to do the task while being simple. Dynamic elements such as inline editing are used sparsely, but are there where appreciated.

h2. Feedback

CyDoc is not the average Medical Desktop Application. It is built using the same technologies and principles as well known internet services like Facebook, tel.search.ch or GMX. This allows very fast development and roll-out times. Every feedback, both positive and negative is very much appreciated.
